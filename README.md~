Code Talk is a library that leverages the Python binding of Meta's Llama model to help users 'talk' to their code. This is achieved through in context learning through which the user can provide the model the codebase that they would like to interact with and through the usage of a vector store and a similarity search, given a query the model learns new information from the provided documents dynamically.
